            <div class="row">
                <p class="left">I'm Matthew Sklepowich. I've completed 2 years of college at DigiPen Institute of Technology for Game Design, and have worked multiple jobs in retail. My favorite job that I have worked at was 'Portal: Virtual Reality', which is a virtual reality (VR) arcade where people can rent booths to play VR games and get immersed in VR experiences.</p>
                <p class="right"> I'm still a bit young at only 22 years old, so I'm not entirely set on any goals in life. I am however greatly enjoying learning various programming languages with CodeFellows! Programming is a great way to create personal experiences that others can enjoy, which is why I fell in love with Game Design in the first place.</p>
